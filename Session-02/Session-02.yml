  - GAN Architecture
  - GAN Architecture Types
    - Vanilla GAN : This is the simplest, origanl GAN Architecture
    - DCGAN : This introduced additional layers of transposed and convolutional layers to the Original GAN Architecture
    - CycleGAN : Make changes or translation between image to image
    - StyleGAN : Introduced by NVIDIA, basically it generate high quality photo realistic images
    - WGAN
    - BigGAN
    - InfoGAN
    - ...
    
  - GAN Training
    - 2 Components:
      - Generator
      - Discriminator
    - Minimax Objectives -> NN Generator and NN Discriminator
    - Training Steps
      - 1. Train the discriminator
        - use real data labeled as 1 and generated (fake) data labeled as 0
      - 2. Train the generator
        - Pass random noise to the generator and use the discriminator to determine if the generated image is real or fake
        - Update the generator using the feedback from discriminator
      - 3. Repeat step 1. and 2. until the discriminator arrives at quality margin,

  - GAN Applications
    - Image Generation
    - Image to Image Translation
    - Style Transfer from Image to Image (Text to Image)
    - Text to Image generation to generate synthetic data
    - Video Synthesis
    - Face Generation (Object Generation)
